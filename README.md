# my-project
This project is a Bus Reservation System specially designed for rural areas to make bus booking simple and accessible. It is developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP for the front end, and MySQL for the backend. The project runs on XAMPP, using Apache as the server and MySQL as the database. It includes pages such as login, available routes, location view, and seat booking, allowing users to easily view bus schedules and make reservations. All data, including user details, routes, and bookings, is stored and managed in the MySQL database. The main objective of this project is to provide a convenient and user-friendly platform for people in rural areas to check bus availability and reserve seats online.
